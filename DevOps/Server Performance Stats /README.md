# Server Performance Stats roadmap.sh Solution

This script is my solution to the "Server Performance Stats" project on roadmap.sh, found here: https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats


## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/fuko-dev/roadmap.sh-projects.git
    cd DevOps/Server\ Performance\ Stats\ /
    ```

2. **Make the script executable**
    ```
    chmod +x server-stats.sh
    ```
3. **Execute the script**  
    ```
    ./server-stats.sh
    ```
This project is part of [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats) DevOps projects.
